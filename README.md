<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
# About The Project

In this homework, we were tasked with creating a daily planner that scheduled a basic work day - from 9-5.  The planner needed to receive input from the user and save the content when the save button is pressed.  The schedule blocks will also respond to the time of the day representing current, past, and future events.  


## Technologies Used
    * Basic: HTML, CSS, Javascript
    * JQuery
    * Bootstrap
    * FontAwesome
